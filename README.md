# VUTTR-CHARLIETZU

This repository contains a Tool management application using React and makes requests for a third-party API that contains all the data to be manipulated. <br />

Basically a CRUD application that we can filter by the items requested for the API. <br />

### WARNING
This project is not yet finished, i haven't yet applied any clean code technique, nor isolated components, i will make some major changes to its structure when the Redux implementation starts, so...don't be scared! Any doubt? Please, open a issue or contact me via e-mail.
